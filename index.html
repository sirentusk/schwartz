        <p>"The idea behind the scale is that there is an internal order and structure to values. Using various statistical techniques, Schwartz has found that the ten basic human values show a pattern of relationships that can be graphed as a circle. Values that are next to each other are closely related; values that are across from each other tend to be opposed, or tend not to be strongly endorsed by the same person. Political liberals have been found to endorse the "openness to change" values, while conservatives are more likely to endorse the "conservation" values. We have put this scale up on YourMorals because we are interested in learning how Schwartz's ten values (which include moral and non-moral values) relate to the "five foundations of morality" theory from Haidt and Graham, as measured by the "Moral Foundations Questionnaire."</p>

        <p>I think I like tradition a little more than the average person because its something that can be "hacked". You need to learn to navigate the system to put something new into it, so you end up eventually admiring the extremely well oiled pieces of the machine that someone before you has perfectly crafted.
        Suprised at other peoples power scores as I thought mine was very low, didn't realise everyone's was so mine was slightly higher than the average.</p>

        <p>High school: Power, Achievement, Hedonism, Stimulation, Security.</p>
        <p>Bachelor: Self-Direction, Tradition.</p>
        <p>Grad Degree: Universalism, Benevolence, Conformity, Conformity.</p>
        <p>I tend to find I agree usually with the caucus of "practical people" who left school early and people whom are interested in learning for the enjoyment (grad).</p>
        <p>I tend to find people who "get a degree because everyone else is" in the middle, causes me issues with conformity even though I also fit into this bracket myself but I studied online and didn't interact with the milieu due to disinterest partly cause I was older.</p>
        <p>I'd imagine 30 years ago when the IQ level was higher for the bachelor level would have made me have a different reaction.</p>

        <p>Like a liberal: Hedonism, Stimulation, Self-Direction, Universalism, Security, Conformity.
        Like a convervative: Power (2.5 vs 2.48), Achievement, Benevolence, Tradition.
        Nearly totally evenly split, hence, Libertarian who genuinely agrees with both sides.</p>

        <p>What am I going to say? That I attribute myself to difference races? Doesn't seem as useful Self evaluation to do that but interesting nevertheless for averages.</p>

        <p>Like a non-religious: Hedonism, Self-Direction, Conformity, Security.
        Like a moderately religious: Power, Achievement, Stimulation, Universalism,
        Tradition (2.8 vs 2.37 [0.43] vs 3.26 [0.46]).
        Like a slightly religious: Benevolence.
        <p>Makes sense to me. I'd say I am a moderately "religious" / "spiritual" person.</p>
